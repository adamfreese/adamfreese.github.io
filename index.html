Welcome to my personal website!
The site is currently under construction.
Since it's registered under a .org domain, I'll aim for this website to
be educational.
My main interests are physics
(mainly quantum mechanics and quantum field theory)
and music (especially microtonal and Xenharmonic music),
so I'll make a point to provide educational resources on both these topics.
